Cookbook for iPad
====

This was a simple app I wrote for my mom for mother's day. I wanted to create an easy to use cookbook where she could organize and store all of her recipes, as well as be able to easily share them if she wanted to.




SqLite, PHP, Jquery
---
I wrote this using technologies I was quite familiar with so I could get it done in the minimal amount of time I had available. Most of the code is self explanatory and properly uses proper PHP PDO drivers to prevent sql injection attacks.


Installation
-----
Clone the repo and drop all files into a php5+ compatible server. Since it uses SqLite no other installation or configuration should be necessary.
